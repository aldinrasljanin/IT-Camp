          Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM ( born 5 February 1985)
          is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for
          Premier League club Manchester United and captains the Portugal
          national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all
          time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards and four European Golden
          Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 32 trophies in his
          career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues,
          and the UEFA European Championship. Ronaldo holds the records for most
          appearances (183), goals (140), and assists (42) in the Champions
          League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals
          (117), and international appearances by a European (191). He is one of
          the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career
          appearances, and has scored over 800 official senior career goals for
          club and country. Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP,
          before signing with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18, winning the FA
          Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive
          Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World
          Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject
          of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he
          signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80
          million), where he won 15 trophies, including two La Liga titles, two
          Copa del Rey, and four Champions Leagues, and became the club's
          all-time top goalscorer. He won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and
          2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind
          Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. In 2018, he signed for
          Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million),
          the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over
          30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppe Italiana, and
          a Coppa Italia, before returning to Manchester United in 2021. Ronaldo
          made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and
          has since earned over 190 caps, making him Portugal's most-capped
          player. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also
          the nation's all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored
          at 11 major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at
          Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed
          captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was
          named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese
          Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their
          first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver
          Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. He also led
          them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, and
          later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020. One of the
          world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the
          world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016 and 2017 and the
          world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included
          him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in
          2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1
          billion in his career.
